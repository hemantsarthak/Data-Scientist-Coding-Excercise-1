Koneksys Data Scientist Coding Excercise 2

Hi Avishek & Axel, I have created a scraper using puppeteer as described in the Google doc.

Here is the index.js scraping output:

Though I thought SKU is a better id based identifier so I made a slightly refined json output as well:

## You can test the code by:
```
git clone https://github.com/hemantsarthak/Koneksys-Data-Scientist-Coding-Excercise-2.git 
```
Enter username & pswrds in cli

Change directory to cloned folder

Run the following commands:
```
npm install
node .
```
You will have a file named **products.json** in your directory.

![Output Received](https://i.imgur.com/AcsQahp.png)

If you want to see the refined json instead of ```node .``` use:
```
node refined.js
```
You will have a file named **refinedproducts.json**.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any other coding exercise you want me to solve at:

Also Alex, I sincerely apologize for the delay in code submission, you gave me the exersice on Saturday 7 and I am submitting it on Thursday 13 when I said I would do it by Sunday 8. There was a minor medical emergency in my family due to which I was not able to submit it sooner, I apologize for it.

Hope you understand,**I really think Koneksys is a great fit for me where I can work, learn & grow a lot so please hire me if possible. I would work hard to ensure Koneksys succeeds in any manner needed both as a team player or an individual entity as needed.**

Have a great day!
Thank You
